Clunk-Genesis
=============

3-3-14 After discovering that the slow World Generation was due to Instanciate, I bit the bullet and purchased a pool manager that looks increadible. Major tools now in the project.

6-29-13 We are starting back at zero. Plan is to create a work environment that this project will grow cleanly while new ideas can be tested easily.
